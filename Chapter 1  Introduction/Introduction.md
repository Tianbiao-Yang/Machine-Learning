## Machine Learning definition

    如果P可以用来评估程序在某任务T的性能，若一个程序通过利用经验E在任务T上获得了提升，则我们就说关于P和T，该程序对经验E进行了学习。常用英文定义为：`A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E`. 也就是用数据和以往的经验，优化程序性能。
